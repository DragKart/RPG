# RPG
Purpose
Create a scaled down role playing game that takes places in at 4x4 grid (matrix, array…be creative). This does NOT have to be Warrior, Druid, Rogue...it could be other types, like the examples in class (Pirates, Traders, etc...), but similar in build to this.
Instructions:
Create a character

User can input a unique name
Choice class. Warrior, Druid, Rogue and/or your own choosing. You must have at least 3 of these. They should have appropriate bonuses for their class when asked how many points to put to each attribute. Notice that all bonuses add up to 10. Do not exceed that bonus, otherwise you will end up with a class that is overpowered.

The user will be able to assign a total 25 talent points for their character. For example, the warrior could put 10 points in strength, 5 points in agility, and 10 points in stamina. After the bonuses total up, he has 30 strength, 10 agility, and 30 stamina. A word of note: Strength is how much damage will be done by physical attacks, Agility is their ability to dodge attacks and the chance to make a critical strike attack (1.5 times damage), Stamina is how much hit points they have, Intelligence is how much mana for spell casting the character has, and Spirit is how strong the spell cast is as well as how quickly mana and hit points regenerate (5 per move when not fighting, for example). 
Give each character 1000 gold to purchase items. Give them 3 choices for each 4 parts they need to buy for (Weapon, Head, Body, Feet). There should be 1great item, 1 good item, and 1 ok item. The great item will add +10 attibute, the good item will add +5, and the ok item will add +2. Examples would be a warrior getting a Great Axe +10 Strength, or a Druid getting a Good Cloak +3 Intel and +2 Spirit. Notice how the bonus totaled 5 for the good item. 
Each character should have the ability to (A)ttack, (D)odge, (C)ast a spell, or attempt to (R)un. In all cases, when the character fights a monster, if the character’s health reaches 0 he/she is defeated and vice versa for if the monster’s health reaches 0.
Monsters
The monsters are not nearly as in depth as the characters. You only need to have health and how much damage they can do. You should have at least 5 different types of monsters in your area ranging from weak to strong. The weak should be the most common and the strongest should be unique...probably the boss character. Attacks should not be the same damage for every attack, but be random within a certain range (think dice lab). When the encounter is over, the character can proceed walking through the area.
Environment
This will be a 4x4 area. It can be a castle, a dungeon, town, or whatever you would like. The character should be able to navigate using (N)orth, (W)est, (E)ast, and (S)outh for commands.
